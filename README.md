### Commit message style change
> After reading [How to Write a Git Commit Message by Chris Beams](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/),
> we adopted a title-subject commit message scheme. While most of
> what is stated in that article is extremely useful, it will take some
> time to get accustomed to - esspecially using the imperative tense. We hope
> by the end of this project that all seven steps will be implemented in full 
> function and serve as resourceful documentation for later dates.
>
> Commit messages of this style were implemented starting on 02/18/18
